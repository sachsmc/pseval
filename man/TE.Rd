\title{Treatment efficacy contrast functions}
\usage{
TE(R0, R1)
}
\arguments{
\item{R0}{A vector of risks in the control arm}

\item{R1}{A vector of risks in the treatment arm}
}
\value{
A vector the same length as R0 and R1.
}
\description{
Treatment efficacy contrast functions
}
\details{
These functions take the risk in the two treatment arms, and
  computes a one-dimensional summary of those risks. Built-in choices are
  \code{"TE"} for treatment efficacy = 1 - risk_1(s)/risk_0(s), \code{"RR"} for
  relative risk = risk_0(s)/risk_1(s), \code{"logRR"} for log of the relative
  risk, and \code{"RD"} for the risk difference = risk_0(s) - risk_1(s).
