Description: Contains the core methods for the evaluation of principal surrogates in a single clinical trial.
            Provides a flexible interface for defining models for the risk given treatment and the surrogate,
            the models for integration over the missing counterfactual surrogate responses, and the estimation
            methods. Estimated maximum likelihood and pseudo-score can be used for estimation, and the bootstrap
            for inference. A variety of post-estimation summary methods are provided, including print, summary,
            plot, and testing.
