# pseval: Methods for Evaluating Principal Surrogates of Treatment Response

## Installation

`pseval` is an R package aimed at implementing existing methods for surrogate evaluation using a flexible and common interface. Development will take place  on [the Github page](https://github.com/sachsmc/pseval), and the current version of the package can be installed from CRAN. 

```
install.packages("pseval")
```

Check out the [vignette](https://sachsmc.github.io/pseval) for methodological details and information on how to use the package.

Check out the [cheat sheet](https://sachsmc.github.io/pseval-course/pseval-cheatsheet.pdf) for a quick reference.
